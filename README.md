<h1>What is Latex ?</h1>

LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech» (to rhyme with «blech» or «Bertolt Brecht»),
is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or 
scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.
LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents 
but to concentrate on getting the right content.

<h3>LaTeX Features</h3>

- Typesetting journal articles, technical reports, books, and slide presentations.
- Control over large documents containing sectioning, cross-references, tables and figures.
- Typesetting of complex mathematical formulas.
- Advanced typesetting of mathematics with AMS-LaTeX.
- Automatic generation of bibliographies and indexes.
- Multi-lingual typesetting.
- Inclusion of artwork, and process or spot colour.
- Using PostScript or Metafont fonts.

<h3>Output types generated by Latex</h3>

- DVI (Device independent file format)
- PDF (Portable document format )
- PS  (PostScript File format)
*but default is a pdf format*

<h3>Latex document structure is divided into two parts</h3>
1. Preamble (the preamble contains commands that established the basic parameters for the document)
2. Document Environment

**Preabmle**

```
\documentclass{article}
```
 The **document class** tells latex what type of document you're making which tells it to load  certain features my default choice for general
 
```
\documentclass{Beamer}
```
This class is used for creating PPTs.

**Packages**
There are 2 ways of installing a package
1. Install during compilation 
2. Manual installation using MikteX's package installer


**Document environment**
The document environment is where the actual contents of the document will go the document environment starts at begin document ```\begin{document}```
and ends at end document ```\end{document}```

<hr>

**BASIC TEXT MANIPULATION**
Create a simlpe doacument using Latex
*Note: The extention of any Latex file is ```.tex``` *
- Compile the file using ```pdf latex hello.tex``` or using  ```pdf latex hello``` here it will bydefault add the extention
- A .log ifile is created after the execution of this command
- To read the pdf file ```skim hello.pdf``` command is used

**IMPORTING FILES**
<br>
The standard tool to insert a latex file into another are \input and \include<a href = "https://sharelatex.psi.ch/learn/Management_in_a_large_project#Reference_guide">   (see the reference guide)</a>, but these are prone to errors if nested file importing is needed. For this reason the recommended option is the package import .
